Need a way to mark the render-tree dirty.

This is the tree that gets created during the cull traversal.

If it's not dirty then it can just be rendered again, skipping the cull.

Can the renderer handle the task of smartly packing the vertices?

That way the application code doesn't have to think about an alternative
organization of the data.

It can organize it according to the original structure, follow the CAD
hierarchy, for example.
